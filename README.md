# Does It Bechdel API

This is a Ruby-based API that serves as the backend of Does It Bechdel, a data visualization tool that exposes sexism in Hollywood by using a dataset from FiveThirtyEight of over 1,700 movies. I used the Open Movie Database (OMdB) to expand the information in the data set by associating actors and directors with the films.

The front-end react-based single-page application can be found [here](https://github.com/tsengsational/does-it-bechdel-client).
